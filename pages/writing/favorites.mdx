## 1. Grammarly

I should probably start with the tool that helped me correct the title and subhead I just wrote. This app is the best tool I discovered this past quarter. I was impressed with Hemingway (what I was using before), but Grammarly blows it out of the water.
It has helped make me a better writer and understand how I sound to others. I use it almost every time I touch a keyboard, and apps that provide that type of constant utility are worth their weight in gold.

## 2. Moonlander Keyboard

I love ergonomics, and I love efficiency. This keyboard is the perfect combination of the two. I think that is saying a lot because I had the Kinesis Advantage 2 before the Moonlander and was plenty happy with it.

The Moonlander has a special place in my heart because I shattered my wrist and bought the keyboard to put the left half on my lap and still type. Now that I’m healed up, it is still my absolute favorite ergo product I own.

Check out my Moonlander keyboard configuration walkthrough to see how I’m using it for maximum efficiency. The best part about Moonlander is configuring each key for tap, double-tap, hold, and tap-hold key bindings. For instance, I bound holding C to “Copy” and V to “Paste.”
