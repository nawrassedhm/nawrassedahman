What is a good design system? Depending on who you ask, it can mean different things. Good for who? In what way is it good? How do I measure its goodness? I think this is normally where someone peeks in and yells: ‚ÄúYou need values!‚Äù. But here‚Äôs the thing: I never found it helpful to refer to a set of broad or obvious buzz words like **‚ÄúSimple, Valuable, and Clear‚Äù**.

<Aside label="üí° Insight">
  When faced with a difficult choice while designing, broad adjectives aren‚Äôt
  helpful. ‚ÄúSimple‚Äù can mean drastically different things depending on the
  person and the product.
</Aside>

Turns out what I really needed was a set of **principles**. In my experience, [companies interchange the terms principles, standards, and values](https://principles.adactio.com/) so allow me to elaborate on how I have come to use them.

## What are Values?

Values are qualities that drive principles. They are the small carefully chosen subset of intentionally broad (bordering on obvious) adjectives that serve as a mechanism to inform principles. They describe how a product should feel when using it. Values are helpful, but in my opinion, not on their own.

## What are Principles?

Principles are the practical, stern, opinionated standards that guide decision making. They reinforce the core values and help decisions move in a consistent direction.

<Aside>
  Most importantly, they are catchy, memorable, and specific sentiments that
  unify the product experience under varying circumstances.
</Aside>

I‚Äôve been curating my personal values (and principles) over the years to be more conscious of what I value when maintaining a design system. I didn‚Äôt even call them ‚Äúprinciples‚Äù until recently. They were always just my ‚Äúopinions‚Äù that I didn‚Äôt write down.

For me, they apply to component creation, governance, maintenance, and being a supportive design systems teammate. They aren‚Äôt written in stone. **They are a baseline for me to measure against so I can be deliberate about change as I mature in my role.**

If I‚Äôm honest, they shift monthly (just like a design system). Some weeks I‚Äôm a hammer of righteous indignation, some weeks I‚Äôm Mother Teresa.

## My Values

Simple, Intuitive, Flexible, Inclusive

## My Principles

### 1. Tools over rules

Think of the system as a toolbox, not an instruction manual. Support the community, don‚Äôt block them. Design systems are about empowering others with tools and information to improve upon what has already been built ‚Äî not police against it.

### 2. Lead by example, not by explanation

Show best practices with real examples, not instructions on how to recreate them. Writing an instruction manual on design patterns is laborious to write and read. **It‚Äôs significantly easier to adopt, understand, update, maintain and implement from live examples.**

<Image src={three} alt="Leading by example vs leading by instruction cartoon" />

Also, a system can‚Äôt, and shouldn‚Äôt, try to predict every situation a component will be used in with documentation. [In my experience, trying to document every scenario](https://medium.com/zendesk-creative-blog/6-tips-for-writing-effective-design-system-documentation-11c35b44169) ends up creating a laundry list of exceptions. For example:
Buttons always lead with a verb‚Ä¶ except for common actions like ‚ÄúDone‚Äù, ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù or ‚ÄúOK‚Äù ‚Ä¶ but OK is only permitted in mobile applications‚Ä¶ and this doesn‚Äôt apply to Button Groups‚Ä¶ and not when button length might cause problems in compact UIs.

### 3. The goal is efficiency, not consistency

There are a lot of goals of a design system: consistency, usability, coherence, consolidation, accessibility, efficiency‚Ä¶ the list goes on. The point of this principle is to remember the primary driver for a design system is not to enforce consistency.

Consistency is a result of efficiency, not the other way around. **When the system is intuitive and empowering to use, consistency becomes an automatic by-product of adoption**. Sure, consistency is a key consideration but when it‚Äôs the main priority of the system it becomes a self-governing restriction that causes stagnation.

## 4. Remove what‚Äôs not absolutely necessary and perfect what remains

It‚Äôs very easy to add. It‚Äôs almost impossible to remove. Every addition should fight to be included. This is a difficult line to draw but complexities that creep into the foundation of a design system propagate out and become much harder to amend if users get accustomed to it.

<Aside>
  The more you add, the more you maintain. **Each time something new is adopted
  into the system, it becomes a pattern to follow in subsequent definitions**.
</Aside>

### 5. Think inclusively

Accessibility is an [integrated part of design system development](https://medium.com/thinking-design/building-accessibility-into-design-systems-db9062893079), not a box to check at the end. Inclusivity is imperative for building successful, ethical products that scale. Not to mention, accessibility is hard and design systems are in the unique position to champion it as a fundamental standard for design, development and content strategy.

### 6. Design systems speak in tokens

How a system defines, references, talks about, and curates its design tokens (of all tiers) is very important. [They are the soul of your system‚Äôs aesthetic](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/), the most fundamental visual building block, and the glue that holds the system together in a way no other part can. It‚Äôs also frequently the code most likely to be leveraged across code bases.

For instance, a color is very rarely only a ‚Äúcolor‚Äù when in a design system. It‚Äôs much more likely an abstracted token like ‚Äúprimary-color‚Äù or ‚Äútext-color‚Äù.
Thinking this way helps abstract the visual aesthetic away from the raw values to [how design attributes get applied to the context of the entire system](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/#using-design-tokens). This is particularly helpful (a requirement, really) when designing with themes in mind.

<Aside>
  Adobe Spectrum‚Äôs [documentation on Design
  Tokens](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/design-tokens/) is particularly
  wonderful.
</Aside>

### 7. The system succeeds when it can be used independent of its creators

This is more of a north star than a principle but I find it to be a particularly useful periodic gut check. The system succeeds when it equips others with the principles, knowledge, and tools to solve problems without the design systems team.

I think about this principle a lot like the proverb _‚ÄúGive a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.‚Äù_ I find it to be a much more rewarding experience when the system strives to inspire the approach to solving problems vs being the catalog of previous solutions to them.

### 8. Flexible enough for different scenarios, specific enough to be useful

This principle is a work in progress for me cause it‚Äôs not an easy one to follow from a practical standpoint.

> Design system principle #5: Favor elegance of simple things over flexibility of complex things.

Modularity is important (especially to encourage adoption) but too much and it starts to feel like a puzzle, too little and it doesn‚Äôt leave enough room for flexibility. Finding the sweet spot depends on the team, business, product, and component.

This topic is incredibly interesting to me. I think it could be several blog posts just by itself. Defining the appropriate level of customization is where design systems get to flex their influence the most but it‚Äôs also the most heavily opinionated.

## Credits

Full disclosure: I appropriated 50% of these principles and internalized them at various points in my career. Some sources I remember, some I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs highly unlikely I wrote a single one of these solely from my own head.

- ‚ÄúTools not rules‚Äù is [from a talk by Jess Clark](https://www.rethinkhq.com/videos/elevating-the-experience-of-your-design-system-jess-clark). To my defense, she said she stole it from a coworker. Originally I was saying ‚ÄúGuidance not governance‚Äù and I tried to change it up to ‚ÄúRationale not rules‚Äù but let‚Äôs be honest, both are shit in comparison.
- ‚ÄúThe system succeeds when it can be used independent of its creators‚Äù is from an [incredible talk by Rich Fulcher](https://www.rethinkhq.com/videos/communicating-design-principles-at-scale-rich-fulcher-material-design-google).
- ‚ÄúFlexible enough to fit different scenarios, specific enough to be useful‚Äù is from my [favorite DS talk of all time](https://vimeo.com/345902050) by Inayaili de Le√≥n Persson.
